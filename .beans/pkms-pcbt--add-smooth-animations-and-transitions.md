Polish the UI with smooth animations and micro-interactions for better feel.

## Animations to Add
**Page Transitions:**
- Fade in/out when navigating between pages
- Slide transitions for mobile navigation

**UI Elements:**
- Button hover effects (scale, color shift)
- Modal/overlay fade in with backdrop blur
- Dropdown/menu slide down animations
- Toast notifications slide in from corner

**Micro-interactions:**
- Submit button: loading spinner → checkmark animation
- File hover: subtle scale + shadow
- Tag hover: color intensity increase
- Folder expand/collapse with smooth height transition

**Scroll Animations:**
- Fade in elements as they scroll into view
- Parallax effect on dashboard (optional)
- Infinite scroll smooth loading

## Design Principles
- Duration: 150-300ms (fast but noticeable)
- Easing: ease-in-out for most, ease-out for exits
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion for accessibility
- Don't overdo it (subtle is better)

## Technical Implementation
- Use Tailwind CSS transitions
- Add CSS custom properties for timing
- Use Framer Motion or similar for complex animations (optional)
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` media query

## Checklist
- [x] Add page transition animations (fade + slide up on page load)
- [x] Add button hover effects (subtle lift on hover, press on active)
- [x] Add modal fade in/out (backdrop blur + modal slide up)
- [ ] Add dropdown slide animations (no dropdowns yet)
- [x] Add submit button animation sequence (spinner already animated)
- [x] Add file/folder hover effects (smooth transitions, color intensity)
- [x] Add tag hover animations (brightness increase)
- [x] Add stagger animations for list items (Browse, Archive)
- [ ] Add toast notification animations (toasts not implemented)
- [x] Respect prefers-reduced-motion (all animations disabled)
- [ ] Test performance on slower devices (needs local testing)
- [x] Ensure 60fps animations (CSS animations, GPU-accelerated)
