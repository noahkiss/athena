Verify all 11 themes work correctly in light and dark modes, ensure native iOS feel, and implement surface elevation overlays for depth.

## Tasks:
- [x] Test theme switching between all 11 themes
- [x] Verify light mode themes (Latte, Dawn, GitHub Light) display correctly
- [x] Verify dark mode themes (all others) display correctly
- [x] Implement surface elevation with subtle overlays for depth
- [x] Ensure iOS native feel across all themes (squircles, system fonts, proper spacing)
- [x] Test auto light/dark detection with system preference changes

All themes tested and verified working. Surface elevation implemented with gradient overlays. iOS native feel achieved through squircle corners, system fonts, proper touch targets, and spacing guidelines.
